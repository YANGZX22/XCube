## Highlights in 1.1.0

- Added an Assistant module for managing multiple assistants, viewing their conversations, and starting assistant-specific chats
- The Assistant module includes custom assistant avatars with text, image links, QQ avatars, and gallery images, rendered more consistently across the app
- The chat card page now uses HDS material navigation with gradient blur, and search, favorites, and title state behave more consistently while scrolling
- Reasoning controls now adapt more precisely to provider and model capability, including auto, low, medium, high, and extra-high levels
- Added the Xiaomi MiMo preset provider; exports now include connection settings by default so imports are ready to use

## Features

### Talk to any model

Connect to 15+ AI providers out of the box. Bring your own API key, pick a model, and start chatting. Add any OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini compatible provider in seconds.

### Tools, web search, and MCP

Built-in web search supports Bing(local), Tavily, and Exa. When a model supports function calling, it can use tools directly, and the tools center can also connect to remote streamable MCP servers.

### Markdown & beyond

Full markdown rendering — code blocks with syntax highlighting, tables, LaTeX formulas, images. Even raw HTML gets a live preview.

### Looks good, feels good

8 color themes. Dark / Light / System mode. API 23 materials, immersive glass-like effects, and real-time blur are all part of the current visual system. A UI that feels native because it is native.

### Phone & tablet ready

Responsive layouts for phones and HarmonyOS tablets. Chat, settings, and provider management all stay comfortable on larger screens.

### Smart Grip

Detects which hand you're holding the phone with and moves the "New Chat" button to the reachable side. One-handed use, done right.

### Your data, your rules

Export and import everything — conversations, provider configs, preferences. JSON format, no lock-in.

### Stays alive in the background

Switch to another app while waiting for a long response. ChatCube keeps working and notifies you when the reply is ready.
